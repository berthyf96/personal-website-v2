			Dear Dad,<br />
			Happy Father's Day to my world-(business)-traveling, Indian-food-loving, pepper-growing dad! I wish you a wonderful day to celebrate all that you do for Mom and me. Although I can't eat nian gao with you today, I'm thinking of you from afar. Thank you for being the goofy one in the family and for doing your best to cheer us up when we need it most. I love you and am looking forward to more traveling, eating (not too much), and shopping adventures with you!<br />
			Love,<br />
			Berthy
